# Convert-PDF-to-Audiobook-using-OCR-Optical-Character-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning
LORO can convert any documented PDF to mp3 audio. It uses complex Deep learning algorithms to analyze the pattern of Title to body in a page and presents only the Important content. It has the ability to remove any miscellaneous content from the page, it can remove the iterative author name or Indexes of a file. It has the ability to select where the actual content is starting rather than reading every single bit of the PDF. It is annoying when the audiobook read out every punctuation in between of a very import   part of the document, rather more disturbing is to listen to every bit of website mentioned. LORO filters out all those stuff for you so you can listen to what you actually intended for. LORO uses the very best API like Vision API, Auto ML API, TextToSpeach API from Google Cloud services. So, it delivers product which is best in class. LORO can not only converted the written documents into audio files but can also recognize text from a human handwriting, further extending its usability.
